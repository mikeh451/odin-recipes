    <h2>Crispy Fried Chicken</h2>
        <p>Cooking chicken is always delicate, but luckily I find making fried chicken is more forgiving.</p>
        <p>It all starts with the right breading and a hot pot of oil. I recoomened peanut oil as it high as much higher smoke point.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2lbs chicken. I like thighs but all cuts work</li>
            <li>3 cups flour</li>
            <li>1 cup corn starch</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp salt</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp pepper</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp paprika</li>
            <li>1-3 quarts oil for frying. Depends on size of pot</li>
            <li>Sauce which I like equal parts Frank's Redhot and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ.</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp Butter</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in large pot on stove on medium high heat. 375 degrees is goal</li>
            <li>Cut chicken into manageble pieces. 2 inch squares is ideal</li>
            <li>Combind flour, corn starch, and spices in large bowl</li>
            <li>Prepare egg wash by whisking eggs and milk in separate, large bowl</li>
            <li>Cover chicken in flour mix completely</li>
            <li>Bathe flour covered chicken in egg wash</li>
            <li>Repeat step 5</li>
            <li>Slowly lower chicken in hot oil. Lightly stir to make sure pieces do not stick</li>
            <li>Cook 14-18 minutes, until chicken internal temp reaches 160 degrees</li>
            <li>Prepare sauce in large bowl starting with softened butter and both sauces</li>
